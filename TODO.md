# Todo List

- [x] profile API endpoint should return repo-url and django id
- [ ] get the toggle working!
- [x] profile loading indicator

## Down the road...

- [ ] how to handle repo name or ownership changes...
    - there doesn't seem to be a webhook for it, so maybe a scheduled task?
- [ ] eventually offer a "delete history" option
