## What is it?

Integrates with a variety of tools that track your deployment status like:

 - HTML Validation
 - Travis CI

And coming very soon:

 - Coveralls
 - Google Page Speed Insights

## Why another deployment tool?

Because it makes sense to keep this all in one place. When I'm
trying to get a bird's eye view of my applications, I found myself
checking the badges in README's and then directly connecting to
evaluation services like HTML Validator and Page Speed Insights.

The upcoming "groups" functionality will make this even easier.
See the Roadmap for more details.
